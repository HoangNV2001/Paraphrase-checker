Paraphrase Identiﬁcation in Vietnamese DocumentsNgo Xuan Bach∗†, Tran Thi Oanh‡, Nguyen Trung Hai∗, Tu Minh Phuong∗†∗Department of Computer Science, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam{bachnx,haint,phuongtm}@ptit.edu.vn†Machine Learning & Applications Lab, Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology, Vietnam‡International School, Vietnam National University, Hanoioanhtt@isvnu.vnAbstract—In this paper, we investigate the task of paraphraseidentiﬁcation in Vietnamese documents, which identify whethertwo sentences have the same meaning. This task has been shown tobe an important research dimension with practical applications innatural language processing and data mining. We choose to modelthe task as a classiﬁcation problem and explore different types offeatures to represent sentences. We also introduce a paraphrasecorpus for Vietnamese, vnPara, which consists of 3000 Vietnamesesentence pairs. We describe a series of experiments using variouslinguistic features and different machine learning algorithms,including Support Vector Machines, Maximum Entropy Model,Naive Bayes, and k-Nearest Neighbors. The results are promisingwith the best model achieving up to 90% accuracy. To the bestof our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to solve the task ofparaphrase identiﬁcation for Vietnamese.Keywords—Paraphrase Identiﬁcation, Semantic Similarity, Sup-port Vector Machines, Maximum Entropy Model, Naive BayesClassiﬁcation, K-Nearest Neighbor.I. INTRODUCTIONParaphrase identication is the task of deciding whether twotext fragments are paraphrases of each other. In this paper, wefocus on sentential paraphrases. To give an example, we showbelow a pair of sentences from our manually built corpus,vnPara 1, in which sentence A is a paraphrase of sentence Band vice versa (see Figure 1).Fig. 1: An example of two Vietnamese paraphrase sentencesand its translation into English.Paraphrase identiﬁcation is important in a number of appli-cations such as text summarization, question answering, ma-chine translation, natural language generation, and plagiarismdetection. For example, detecting paraphrase sentences wouldhelp a question answering system to increase the likelihood ofﬁnding the answer to the user’s question. As a further example,in text summarization, a paraphrase identiﬁcation system canbe used to avoid adding redundant information.1This vnPara corpus will be made available by the authors at publicationtime.Fig. 2: An example of two Vietnamese non-paraphrase sen-tences and its translation into English.Paraphrase identication is not an easy task. Considering theﬁrst sentence pair of sentence A and sentence B above, thispair is a paraphrase although the two sentences only share afew words, while the second one (sentence C and sentence Din Figure 2) is not a paraphrase even though the two sentencescontain almost all the same words.Paraphrase identication has been extensively explored fordocuments written in English and some other popular lan-guages, most notably by Kozareva and Montoyo [9], Fernandoand Stevenson [7], etc. However, to the best of our knowledge,there is no effort done for Vietnamese. A main reason mightbe the lack of annotated corpora.In this paper, we focus on Vietnamese paraphrase identiﬁ-cation, in which we model the task as a binary classiﬁcationproblem and train a statistical classiﬁer to solve it. Ourmethod employs string similarity measures applied to differentabstractions of the input sentence pair. We investigate the taskregarding both learning model and linguistic feature aspects.The contributions of this paper are two-fold:1) We build a corpus annotated with paraphrase identi-ﬁcation labels by extracting paraphrased sentences inonline articles referring to the same topics, followedby manual annotation and statistical veriﬁcation.2) We investigate the impact of different features, in-cluding linguistic ones on the classiﬁcation perfor-mance using different machine learning methods.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2presents previous research on paraphrase identiﬁcation. Section3 introduces in detail our proposed system for Vietnameseparaphrase identiﬁcation. Section 4 describes our corpus andexperimental setups. Experimental results are presented inSection 5. In Section 6, we conduct an analysis of our system’smisclassiﬁcation on the vnPara corpus. Finally, Section 7concludes the paper and discusses our plans for the future.2015 Seventh International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering978-1-4673-8013-3/15 $31.00 © 2015 IEEEDOI 10.1109/KSE.2015.37174
II. RELATED WORKVarious studies on paraphrase identiﬁcation have beenconducted in different languages, especially in English. Finchet al., [8] investigate the utility of applying standard MTevaluation metrics, including BLEU [19], NIST [6], WER [17],and PER [10], to building classiﬁers to predict paraphraserelations. Mihalcea et al., [16] use pointwise mutual informa-tion, latent semantic analysis, and WordNet to compute anarbitrary text-to-text similarity metric. Wan et al., [25] showthat dependency-based features in conjunction with bigramfeatures improve upon the previously published work to giveus the best reported classiﬁcation accuracy on the PAN corpus[15]. Kozareva et al., [9] propose a machine learning ap-proach based on lexical and semantic information, e.g. a wordsimilarity measure based on WordNet. They also model theproblem of paraphrasing as a classiﬁcation task. Their modeluses a set of linguistic attributes and three different machinelearning algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machines, k-NearestNeighbors, and Maximum Entropy, to induce classiﬁers. Theclassiﬁers are built in a supervised manner from labeledtraining data.Fernando and Stevenson [7] present an algorithm forparaphrase identiﬁcation which makes extensive use of wordsimilarity information derived from WordNet. Rus et al. [20]adapt a graph-based approach for paraphrase identication byextending a previously proposed method for the task of textentailment. Das and Smith [5] introduce a probabilistic modelwhich incorporates both syntax and lexical semantics usingquasi-synchronous dependency grammars for identifying para-phrases. Socher et al., [22] introduce a method for paraphrasedetection based on recursive autoencoders. This unsupervisedmethod is based on a novel unfolding objective and learnfeature vectors for phrases in syntactic trees. Madnani et al.,[15] present an investigation of the impact of MT metricson the paraphrase identication task. They examine 8 differentMT metrics, including BLEU, NIST, TER, TERP, METEOR,SEPIA, BADGER, and MAXSIM, and show that a systemusing nothing but some MT metrics can achieve state-of-the-art results on this task.Recently, Bach et al., [1] present a new method namedEDU-based similarity, to compute the similarity between twosentences based on elementary discourse units. They also showthe relation between paraphrases and discourse units, whichplays an important role in paraphrasing.All previous works, except for Nguyen et al. [18], wereperformed for English and other popular languages such asChinese, Japanese, and Korea. Nguyen et al. [18] present amethod for measuring semantic similarity of two Vietnamesesentences based on concepts. The overall semantic similarityis a linear combination of word-to-word similarity, word-order similarity, and concept similarity. Their work, however,focuses on measuring semantic similarity, not on predictingparaphrases. Compared with previous work, our work makesthe ﬁrst effort to solve the task of paraphrase identiﬁcation forVietnamese. In order to conduct experiments, we also builda corresponding corpus for this task, which includes 3000Vietnamese sentence pairs.III. OUR METHODIn this section, we present our method for Vietnameseparaphrase identiﬁcation. The main idea of the method is tocalculate the similarity between two sentences based on variousabstractions of the input sentences. The method is describedin more detail as follows:In general, given a set of nlabelled sentence pairs{S1,1,S1,2,y1,...,Sn,1,Sn,2,yn}, where Si,1and Si,2are the ith sentence pair, yireceives value 1if the twosentences are paraphrases, 0otherwise. Each sentences pairSi,1,Si,2is converted to a feature vector vi, whose values arescores returned by similarity measures that indicate how simi-lar Si,1and Si,2are at various levels of abstraction. The vectorsand the corresponding categories { v1,y1,...,vn,yn} aregiven as input to the supervised classiﬁers, which learns howto classify new vectors v, corresponding to unseen pairs ofsentences S1,S2.In this paper, nine string similarity measures are used,including Levenshtein distance (edit distance), Jaro-Winklerdistance, Manhattan distance, Euclidean distance, co-sine sim-ilarity, n-gram distance (with n=3), matching coefcient,Dice coefﬁcient, and Jaccard coefﬁcient [14]. For each pairof input sentences, we form seven new string pairs si1,si2which correspond to seven abstraction levels of the two inputsentences. The seven new sentence pairs are:1) Two strings consisting of the original syllables2ofS1and S2, respectively, with the original order ofthe tokens maintained.2) As in the previous case, but now the tokens arereplaced by their words.3) As in the previous case, but now the words arereplaced by their part-of-speech tags.4) Two strings consisting of nouns, verbs, and adjectivesof S1and S2, as identiﬁed by a POS tagger, withthe original order of the nouns, verbs and adjectivesmaintained.5) As in the previous case, but keep only nouns.6) As in the case 4, but keep only verbs.7) As in the case 4, but keep only adjectives.In total, 9 string similarity measures combined with 7 stringpairs give 63 values.Figure 3 presents the framework of our method to solvethe Vietnamese paraphrase identiﬁcation task. The frameworkconsists of two main phases: the training and the testing phase.In the training phase, labeled sentence pairs are preprocessedand are used to extract corresponding feature vectors by calcu-lating nine string similarity measures applied to seven differentabstract levels of the input sentences (as shown above). Thesefeature vectors are then used to train a model using some strongmachine learning methods. In the testing phase, the obtainedmodel is used to classify a raw sentence pair after preprocessedand feature-extracted as in the training step into paraphrase ornon-paraphrase labels.2Unlike English words, words in Vietnamese cannot be delimited by whitespaces. Vietnamese words may consist of one or more syllables, and syllablesare delimited by white spaces.175
Fig. 3: A proposed method to solve Vietnamese paraphraseidentiﬁcation.A. Similarity MeasuresWe now describe the nine string similarity measures usedin this paper. The measures are applied to a string pair ofs1,s2.1) Jaro-Winkler distance: The Jaro-Winkler distance [26]is a measure of similarity between two strings. The higher theJaro-Winkler distance for two strings is, the more similar thestrings are. The Jaro distance djof two given strings s1ands2is computed as follows:dj=0if m=013(m|s1|+m|s2|+m−tm)otherwisewhere mis the number of matching characters; and tis halfthe number of transpositions. Jaro–Winkler distance uses apreﬁx scale pwhich gives more favourable ratings to stringsthat match from the beginning for a set preﬁx length l.Giventwo strings s1and s2, their Jaro-Winkler distance dwis:dw=dj+(lp(1 −dj)),where:•djis the Jaro distance for strings s1and s2.•lis the length of common preﬁx at the start of thestring up to a maximum of 4 characters.•pis a constant scaling factor for how much the scoreis adjusted upwards for having common preﬁxes. pshould not exceed 0.25, otherwise the distance canbecome larger than 1. The standard value for thisconstant in Winkler’s work is p=0.1.2) Levenshtein Distance: The Levenshtein distance is astring metric for measuring the difference between two se-quences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between twostrings is the minimum number of single word (token) edits(i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to changeone string into the other. It is named after Vladimir Leven-shtein, who considered this distance in 1966 [11].3) Manhattan Distance: The Manhattan distance [13] func-tion computes the distance that would be traveled to get fromone data point to the other if a grid-like path is followed.The Manhattan distance between two items is the sum of thedifferences of their corresponding components.The formula for this distance between a point X=(X1,X2, ...)and a point Y=(Y1,Y2, ...)is:d=ni=1|xi−yi|where nis the number of distinct words (tokens) that occur inany of the two strings, and xiand yishow how many timeseach one of these distinct words occurs in each of these twostrings, respectively.4) Euclidean Distance: Similarly to previous case, we alsorepresent two strings in n-dimensional vector space and theEuclidean distance [13] between two strings is calculated asfollows:L2(x, y)=ni=1(xi−yi)25) Cosine Similarity: Cosine similarity [13] is a measure ofsimilarity between two vectors of an inner product space thatmeasures the cosine of the angle between them. It is deﬁnedas follows:cos(x, y)= x.yx×yIn our system x and y are as above, except that they are binary,i.e., xiand yiare 1or 0, depending on whether or not thecorresponding word (or tag) occurs in the ﬁrst or the secondstring, respectively.6) N-gram distance: This is the same as the Manhattandistance, but instead of words we use all the (distinct) charactern-grams in two strings. In experiments, we used n=3.7) Matching coefﬁcient: This simple matching coefﬁcientcounts how many common words (tags) that two strings have.8) Dice coefﬁcient: The Dice coefﬁcient [13] is a statisticused for comparing the similarity of two samples and iscalculated as follows:2×|X∩Y||X|+|Y|where Xand Yare the sets of (unique) words (or tags) oftwo strings, respectively.9) Jaccard Coefﬁcient: The Jaccard coefﬁcient [13] mea-sures similarity between ﬁnite sample sets, and is deﬁned asthe size of the intersection divided by the size of the union ofthe sample sets:J(A, B)= |A∩B||A∪B|where again X and Y are as in the Dice coefﬁcient.IV. DATA A ND EXPERIMENTAL SETUPA. DataTo build the Vietnamese paraphrase corpus, we ﬁrstcollected articles from online news websites such asdantri.com.vn, vnexpress.net, thanhnien.com.vn, etc. Each doc-ument was preprocessed through natural language processingsteps including, sentence separator (VnSentDetector3), word3http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/phuonglh/softwares/vnSentDetector176
segmenter(VnTokenizer4), and POS tagger (VnTagger5). Afterthat, we extracted pairs of two sentences in two differentdocuments, which refer to the same topics, if the two sentencescontain several similar words. Obtained sentence pairs werethen labeled as paraphrases or non-paraphrases dependingon whether they bear the almost same meaning or not. Wehad two people performing this labeling step. They workedindependently. Then, we used Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient [3]to measure inter-annotator agreement for labeling paraphrasesbetween two annotators. The Cohen’s kappa coefﬁcient wascalculated as follows:k=Pr(a)−Pr(e)1−Pr(e)where Pr(a)is the relative observed agreement between twoannotators, and Pr(e)is the hypothetical probability of chanceagreement. The Cohens kappa coefﬁcient of our corpus was0.9in this case. This means that the agreement between thesetwo annotators was high, and could be interpreted as almostperfect agreement. As a result, a complete corpus was built.This corpus includes 3000 sentence pairs, 1500 of whichwere labeled as paraphrases (labeled as 1) and the other 1500sentence pairs were not (labeled as 0).B. Experimental Setup1) The method for conducting experiments: We randomlydivided the corpus into 5folds and conducted 5-fold cross-validation test. We report results using two widely-used per-formance metrics, which are accuracy, and the F1score asfollows:Accuracy =#of correctly identiﬁed pairs#of pairs ,andF1=2∗P recision ∗RecallP recision +Recallwhere,P recision =#of correctly identiﬁed pairs#of identiﬁed pairs ,andRecall =#of correctly identiﬁed pairs#of gold pairs .The accuracy was the percentage of correct predictions overall the test set, while the F1score was computed only basedon the paraphrase sentence pairs (label 1). All scores wereaveraged over ﬁve folds.2) Feature Selection: Our feature extraction method isbased on sentences pairs. Their values are scores returnedby similarity measures that indicate how similar the twoinput sentences are at various levels of sentence abstraction.Corresponding to 7 representations of the input sentences,which are based on sets of words, syllables, part-of-speechtags, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and a combination of nouns,verbs, and adjectives, we form 7 kinds of feature sets. Inother word, each kind of features corresponds to a type ofrepresentations of the input sentence. For each kind of features,we calculate 9 similarity measures as described in Section 3.1.4http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/phuonglh/softwares/vnTokenizer5http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/phuonglh/softwares/vnTaggerTABLE I: The experimental results using different feature setsFeature Sets Accuracy (%) F1(1) words 89.03 87.06(2) syllables 88.73 86.71(3) Part-of-speech tags 88.63 85.96(4) Combination of n, v, and a 88.33 86.38(5) nouns 85.90 83.89(6) verbs 82.50 81.13(7) adjectives 75.37 72.75TABLE II: The experimental results using different combina-tions of feature setsFeature Sets Accuracy (%) F1(1) 89.00 86.71(1)+(2) 88.97 87.06(1)+(2)+(3) 88.93 87.01(1)+(2)+(3)+(4) 89.10 86.77(1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5) 88.90 86.89(1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5)+(6) 88.83 86.90(1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5)+(6)+(7) 88.77 86.693) Learning Algorithms: To conduct experiments, we usedfour classiﬁcation algorithms, including SVM [24], MEM[2], k-NN [21], and Naive Bayes classiﬁers [21]. These fourmethods are also successfully applied for this task in otherlanguages.4) Experimental Purposes: In experiments, we performedthree types of experiments and their purposes are as follows:•To investigate the effectiveness of each kind of fea-tures.•To conduct feature selection in order to ﬁnd the bestfeature set.•To investigate different machine learning methods.In the ﬁrst two experiments, we chose the SVM as thelearning method.V. E XPERIMENTAL RESULTSA. Different feature typesThis section describes experimental results of paraphraseidentiﬁcation using seven different feature types separately.Table I presents the experimental results using these 7 featuresets. The results show that features extracted based on theword representation of sentence pairs yielded the highestperformance. The second best results were achieved withfeatures extracted based on the syllables representation. Thisis reasonable because the words and syllables keep originalmeaning of the input sentences.B. Combinations of different feature setsBased on the experimental results of the previous section,we gradually combined feature sets using the performanceof each feature set. Feature sets which yielded the higherperformance will have higher priorities. Table II presents theexperimental results using these combinations.The results show that the combination of all representationlevels of sentences pairs, including words, syllables, pos tags,nouns, verbs, and adjectives, yielded the highest performance.177

Different Machine Learning MethodsWe also conducted experiments to investigate performanceof different machine learning methods for this task. We chosethe combination of feature sets yielding the highest perfor-mance according to the previous experimental results. Thatwas the combination of feature sets of (1)+(2)+(3)+(4). TableIII presents the experimental results using this combinationon different machine learning methods. Here is the list of thesoftware tools used in this experimental setting:•For the SVM method, we chose LibSVM6written byChih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin [4].•For the three remaining classifying methods, we choseWEKA software7to perform experiments.Experimental results showed that the SVM method per-formed slightly better than other learning methods, includingMEM, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor, on the Viet-namese paraphrase identiﬁcation task.VI. ERROR ANALYSISIn this section, we analyze main types of errors that oursystem made. First, we perform statistics using 7 kinds ofbase models, which corresponds to 7 different feature sets (aspresented in Section 5.1). Table IV presents some ﬁgures of:•With each sentence pair in corpus, how many modelsamong seven base models produced a correct output?•How many sentence pairs were predicted correctly byat least one base model? And therefore, how manysentence pairs were unable to be predicted correctlyby base models?6http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ cjlin/libsvm/7http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/Fig. 4: Examples of two types of errors caused by our systemthat wrongly predict paraphrase sentences as non-paraphrases.Fig. 5: Examples of two types of errors caused by our systemthat wrongly predict non-paraphrase sentences as paraphrases.We also observe the output of the ﬁnal system (the bestmodel which uses a SVM classiﬁer as the machine learningmethod and the combination of the ﬁrst four types of featuresets) and analyze errors based on two main types: the ﬁrst typecontains some main causes that lead the system wrongly identi-ﬁes paraphrase sentence pairs as non-paraphrases, and the sec-ond type lists some main causes that lead the system wronglyidentiﬁes non-paraphrase sentence pairs as paraphrases.A. Paraphrases (predicted as non-paraphrases)•Using totally different words: two sentences in a pairusing very different words (or rewritten using lots ofnew words). An example is the case 1 as shown inFigure 4.•Complex or compound sentences: rewrite a sentenceusing multiple clauses. An example is the case 2 asshown in Figure 4.•Typing errors: There exist some sentences in thecorpus, that contain typos and spelling errors thatmake the system cannot judge correctly.B. Non-paraphrases (predicted as paraphrases)•Containing: These sentence pairs consist of two sen-tences in which one of them contains the other onebut has additional parts. This is similar to the relation178
of textual entailment. An example is given by the case3 in Figure 5.•Misleading lexical overlap: These sentence pairs con-sist of two sentences which have large lexical overlap.They share a lot of words and contain only a fewdifferent words. However, these few different wordsmake the meaning change. An example is given bythe case 4 in Figure 5.Therefore, the system needs to use more semantic featuressuch as ontology, dictionary of synonyms and asynonym, etc.VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKAlthough the role of paraphrase identiﬁcation has beenproved to be important in many NLP and DM applications forEnglish and other popular languages, there exists no researchon this ﬁeld for Vietnamese. This paper marks our ﬁrst workto this interesting research direction.Throughout the paper, we have presented a method torecognize paraphrases given pairs of Vietnamese sentences.The method uses nine string similarity measures applied toseven different abstract levels of the input sentences. Wealso introduced a corpus built manually, which consists of3000 paraphrase-labeled Vietnamese sentence pairs to conductexperiments. Experiments were performed in a supervisedmanner, in which we combine different feature sets usingstrong machine learning methods. The experimental resultsshowed that the proposed method got the highest performanceof 89.10% accuracy, and 86.77% in the F1score when us-ing the combinations of four feature sets (including words,syllables, pos tags, and the combination of nouns, verbs, andadjectives) and a single SVM classiﬁer.To improve the performance of our method, in the futurewe plan to integrate more features to include semantic infor-mation from synonym dictionaries. Another aspect is that ourcurrent method works at lexical levels, therefore, we also addsome other features that operate on the grammatical relationssuch as the information extracted from dependency tree, etc.Further improvements may be possible by including in our sys-tem additional features such as MT scores, Brown clusteringinformation, exploit the resources from other languages, etc.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThis work was partially supported by “KHCN 2015 09Research Grant”, International School, Vietnam National Uni-versity, Hanoi.REFERENCES[1] N.X.

Regarding Vietnamese, there have been two paraphrase corpora published for the language, one of which is vnPara by Bach et al. [4], while the other is VNPC (Vietnamese News Paraphrase Corpus) by Nguyen-Son et al. [5]. Both of these corpora consist of sentence-level paraphrases.
...... In particular, works by Yin et al. [8], Mueller et al. [9], Jiang et al. [10], Zhou et al. [11], among many others, have proposed various methods, ranging from simple string-matching to machine learning and deep learning techniques. In contrast, research on this topic in Vietnamese remains relatively limited, with only two studies conducted by Bach et al. [4] and Nguyen-Son et al. [5].
...... On the one hand, previous literature on the paraphrase identification task in Vietnamese also depends heavily on the string-based methods. For instance, Bach et al. [4] use nine string-based similarity measures combined with seven-string pairs to represent a sentence. As discussed earlier, this method has proven to be rather ineffective in classifying non-trivial instances.
...Vietnamese Sentence Paraphrase Identification using Pre-trained Model and Linguistic KnowledgeArticleJan 2021 Dien Dinh Nguyễn Lê ThànhView... Many studies have been carried out in building a model for measuring cross-language semantic similarity and achieving remarkable results. However, according to personal insights, the researches focusing on English-Vietnamese pairs has not investigated yet; there are just some studies which focus on identifying paraphrase between pairs of Vietnamese documents Bach et al. (2015); Toi et al. (2011). Therefore, in this paper, we will present a model of English-Vietnamese cross-language paraphrase identification, using hybrid feature classes.
...English–Vietnamese cross-language paraphrase identification using hybrid feature classesArticleFull-text availableApr 2019J HEURISTICS Dien Dinh Nguyễn Lê ThànhParaphrase identification plays an important role with various applications in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, bilingual information retrieval, plagiarism detection, etc. With the development of information technology and the Internet, the requirement of textual comparing is not only in the same language but also in many different language pairs. Especially in Vietnamese, detecting paraphrase in the English–Vietnamese pair of sentences is a high demand because English is one of the most popular foreign languages in Vietnam. However, the in-depth studies on cross- language paraphrase identification tasks between English and Vietnamese are still limited. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to identify the English–Vietnamese cross-language paraphrase cases, using hybrid feature classes. These classes are calculated by using the fuzzy-based method as well as the siamese recurrent model, and then combined to get the final result with a mathematical formula. The experimental results show that our model achieves 87.4% F-measure accuracy.ViewShow abstractVietnamese Paraphrase Identification Using Matching Duplicate Phrases and Similar Words: 5th International Conference, FDSE 2018, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, November 28–30, 2018, ProceedingsChapterJan 2018 Quoc NguyenNam-Phong TranNgoc-Vien Pham I. EchizenViewEnglish- Vietnamese Cross-Language Paraphrase Identification MethodConference PaperDec 2017Le Thanh Nguyen Dien DinhParaphrase identification is a very important problem and is used in many natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, bilingual information retrieval, plagiarism detection, etc. With the development of information technology and the internet, the requirement of textual comparing is not only in the same language but also in many different language pairs. Especially in Vietnamese, the need to detect paraphrase in English-Vietnamese pair of sentences is very large because English is a most popular foreign language in Vietnam. However, the in-depth studies on cross-language paraphrase identification task between English and Vietnamese are still limited. In this paper, we propose a method to identify the English-Vietnamese cross-language paraphrase cases using a fuzzy-based method and the BabelNet semantic network. We identify if the pair of sentences is paraphrased by using feature classes and then combine these results into a final one using a mathematical formula. The experimental results show that our model achieves 77.1% F-measure accuracy and has the advantage of the processing speed compared to other methods which have equivalent quality.ViewShow abstractString Comparator Metrics and Enhanced Decision Rules in the Fellegi-Sunter Model of Record LinkageArticleFull-text availableJan 1990 William E. WinklerThis paper describes a string comparator metric that partially accounts for typographical variation in strings such as first name or surname, decision rules that utilize the string comparator, and improvements in empirical matching results. The string comparators are used in production computer matching software during the Post Enumeration Survey for the 1990 Census. The Post Enumeration Survey will use capture/recapture and other statistical techniques to produce a set of adjusted Census cotmts.ViewShow abstractLibsvm: a library for support vector machinesArticleJan 2011C.

Duong Hien NguyenVinh T. VoWe propose a novel method for measuring semantic similarity of two sentences. The originality of the method is the way that it explores the similarity of concepts referred to in the sentences using Wikipedia. The method also exploits Wiktionary to measure word-to-word similarity. The overall semantic similarity is a linear combination of word-to-word similarity, word-order similarity, and concept similarity. We build datasets consisting of 45 Vietnamese sentence pairs and then evaluate the method on these datasets. The results show that in the best cases, concept similarity help improving the performance of our method more than 15% point. The proposed method is language-independent and quite easy to employ. Therefore, one can readily adopt our method to measure semantic similarity for sentences written in other languages.ViewShow abstractLibsvmArticleApr 2011Chih-Chung Chang Chih-Jen LinLIBSVM is a library for Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

We show that a meta-classifier trained using nothing but recent MT metrics outperforms all previous paraphrase identification approaches on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase corpus. In addition, we apply our system to a second corpus developed for the task of plagiarism detection and obtain extremely positive results. Finally, we conduct extensive error analysis and uncover the top systematic sources of error for a paraphrase identification approach relying solely on MT metrics. We release both the new dataset and the error analysis annotations for use by the community.ViewShow abstractExploiting discourse information to identify paraphrasesArticleMay 2014EXPERT SYST APPL Ngo Xuan BachNguyen Le MinhAkira ShimazuViewAn evaluation tool for machine translation: Fast evaluation for machine translation researchArticleFranz Josef Och Gregor Leusch Hermann NeyViewBinary codes capable of correcting insertions and reversalsArticleJan 1966Vladimir I.

}Ngo Xuan Bach, Oanh T. K. Tran, +1 author Tu Minh PhuongPublished 1 October 2015Computer Science2015 Seventh International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE)In this paper, we investigate the task of paraphrase identification in Vietnamese documents, which identify whether two sentences have the same meaning. This task has been shown to be an important research dimension with practical applications in natural language processing and data mining. We choose to model the task as a classification problem and explore different types of features to represent sentences. We also introduce a paraphrase corpus for Vietnamese, vnPara, which consists of 3000… ExpandView on IEEEdoi.orgSave to LibrarySaveCreate AlertAlertCiteShare This Paper4 CitationsBackground Citations1View AllFigures, Tables, and Topics from this paperfigure 2figure 3figure 4figure 5table Itable IItable IIItable IVView All 8 Figures & TablesMachine learningBrown clusteringNatural language processingData miningExperimentF1 scoreString metricPrinciple of maximum entropyDictionaryText corpusBrown CorpusSupervised learningStatistical classificationNaive Bayes classifierSupport vector machineCluster analysisLexiconK-nearest neighbors algorithm4 CitationsCitation TypeCitation TypeAll TypesBackground CitationsHas PDFPublication TypeAuthorMore FiltersMore FiltersFiltersSort by RelevanceSort by Most Influenced PapersSort by Citation CountSort by RecencyVietnamese Sentence Paraphrase Identification using Pre-trained Model and Linguistic KnowledgeD.
